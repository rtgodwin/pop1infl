Description: Estimates zero-truncated one-inflated Poisson and negative binomial models. The models are then used 
to uncover a "counterfactual" distribution where one-inflation has been undone. The counterfactual distribution 
is then used to estimate the size, and characterisitcs, of the hidden members of the population.
